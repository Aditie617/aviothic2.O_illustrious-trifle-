## Overview

**Solène** is an interactive web application that redefines how we celebrate birthdays across distances.  
In an increasingly digital world, emotional connection can fade when loved ones are far away — **Solène** brings that warmth back through an immersive and personalized online experience.

The platform combines aesthetics, interactivity, and sentimentality — featuring a virtual cake that lights up with confetti, a heartfelt digital letter, a playful mini-game, and a Pomodoro timer for mindful moments.



## Problem Statement
